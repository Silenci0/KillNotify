# KillNotify
Displays kill notificaitons based on what weapon you were killed with. This is a ZPS specific plugin.

All weapons have been accounted for and have an associated name for them now, so when you are killed by a survivor weapon, it should so the name in the chat with the user's name in blue. Zombie kills are done with their hands, so it will only show the zombie, in green text, killing a survivor. Support can be added to differentiate carrier hands and normal zombie hands (if desired).
